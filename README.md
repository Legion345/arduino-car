# 🚗 Obstacle Avoiding Car !

Welcome to the Obstacle Avoiding Car project!  A simple exciting autonomous that can navigate its environment using an ultrasonic sensor. 

## 🚀 Overview

The Obstacle Avoiding Car is designed to move forward until it detects an obstacle within 60 cm. When it senses an obstacle, it stops to avoid a collision. This project is a great starting point for anyone interested in robotics and Arduino programming!

## 🛠️ What You’ll Need

- **Arduino Board** (e.g., Arduino Uno)

- **L298N Motor Driver** (to control the motors)

- **2 DC Motors** (for movement)

- **Ultrasonic Sensor** (to measure distance)

- **Jumper Wires** (to connect everything)

- **Power Supply** (to keep your robot running)


🎉 How It Works

    The robot continuously checks the distance to obstacles using the ultrasonic sensor.
    If an obstacle is detected within 60 cm, the robot stops to avoid a collision.
    If the path is clear, the robot moves forward!

🛠️ Future Enhancements

    Add Servo Control: Uncomment the Servo library and implement advanced maneuvers.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Program the robot to turn when it detects an obstacle.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different components, and share your code! The world of robotics is vast and full of possibilities. Happy coding and building!
